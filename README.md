# Elgamal-Cryptosystem

ElGamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffieâ€“Hellman
key exchange. The system provides an additional layer of security by asymmetrically encrypting keys previously used for symmetric
message encryption.
It has two layers :
1.) SHARING OF KEYS USING DIFFIE HELLMAN :
2.) AFFINE CIPHER USING THE SHARED KEY GENERATED
